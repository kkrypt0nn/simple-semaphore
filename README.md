use simple_semaphore;
use std::thread;
use std::{sync::Arc, time::Duration};

fn main() {
    let semaphore = simple_semaphore::Semaphore::new(2);
    for _ in 0..5 {
        let semaphore = Arc::clone(&semaphore);
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let permit = semaphore.acquire();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
            drop(permit);
        });
    }
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(3000));
}
